## FCPA Experiments

In the main function of the "Task 4/fcpa_agent/fcpa_agent.py" file, the experiments gets called. The function to execute the experiment is test_against_bots(bot) 
where bot is a string of the bot you want to test the agent against.

## FCPA Model
Our agent loads its model from the "Task 4/fcpa_agent/fcpa_policy" folder.
